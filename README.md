July/Sept. 2018, Markus Konrad <markus.konrad@wzb.eu> / [Berlin Social Science Center](https://wzb.eu)

This repository for the companion code for the article *oTree: Implementing experiments with dynamically determined data quantity* to be published in a Special Issue on "Software for Experimental Economics" in the *Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance* was integrated into the [otreeutils repository](https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/otreeutils). The example application [otreeutils_example3_market](https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/otreeutils/tree/master/otreeutils_example3_market) contains the full source code.
